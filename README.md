Demonstrating Aspect Oriented Programming in Java

What is Spring AOP?

It enables the aspect-oriented programming in an spring application by enhancing the modularization for concerns such as logging, transaction and security for crosscutting concerns i.e. cut across multiple types and objects.

What we are trying to do here?

We will be creating a simple spring project with the basis of our Aspect.
